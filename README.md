# Test
Virtual youtube
This is a simple work model of a database model . In this project we will show how to update a data and 
remove a data from a database, which will affect the content of the website.
The languages which are used are java,jsp, mysql.
There is a admin page which will help to add any embedded link to the video browsing website with the title which will be given.
There is a login page in which will direct you to video browsing website.I have not used the database to store login data instead ,
I have some logic on the jsp page to log into the website, you may use the database to complete such process.
This all about what I have to say about my project.
